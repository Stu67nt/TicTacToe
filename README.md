# TicTacToe

Hello, if you are here you either want to look at the source code or just play the game. If you want to just play the game follow the instructions below.

NOTE: Build ONLY works on windows devices. If you are on Mac or Linux figure it out yourself lmao.
1. Click on the latest release (bottom right corner).
2. Click on TTT to download the build (will install a compressed .7z file).
3. Locate the download in your downloads folder then extract to to whereever you want.
4. Run TTT.exe
5. Ignore any warnings Windows Defender gives.
6. Enjoy!
